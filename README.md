## ~~PNRR~~
# purr!

Getting started with web development was made extra accessible by PHP through the AMPs: LAMP, WAMP and friends. 

This project seeks to make access to a friendly (but with all of the gory details easily accessible) environment for web application development using a "better" set of tools.

This repo represents the simplest and least invasive way to get started with ___purr___. Docker is required.

While it might be accurate to call this:

 - P = [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
 - N = [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
 - R = [redis](https://redis.io/)
 - R = [(open)resty](https://openresty.org/)

__PNRR__ is a mouthful. So much better to ___purr___, no?
